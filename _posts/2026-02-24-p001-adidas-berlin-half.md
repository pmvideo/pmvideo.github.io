      Lyric video for John Stammer's song <em>"Idle I'm"</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I discovered this track a bit randomly on an ambient DJ set. It kept looping in my head and when trying to pull up the track on YouTube, I realized it didn't have any sort of music video or visuals to accompany it.

    <p>
      The song fills me with memories of end of summer days in California – those times teetering between September and October where the heat begins to dip a few notches and the bittersweet feeling that the best days are behind you.
